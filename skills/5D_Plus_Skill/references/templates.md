SCRIPTED NOTES (Timestamped Evidence)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

00:45 – T: "Today we're determining if relationships are proportional by 
analyzing tables and graphs." [P1, LT]

03:12 – T: Posts success criteria on slide: "I can explain why a relationship 
is or isn't proportional using at least two pieces of evidence." [P2, SC]

07:30 – S-A: "The ratio between y and x is always 3, so it's proportional." [SE1]

07:45 – T: "Say more about that—why does a constant ratio matter?" [SE1, A1]

08:02 – S-A: "Because that means the unit rate doesn't change." [SE1]

## Noticings & Wonderings
```
NOTICINGS (Evidence-Based Observations)

1. [SE1, SE3 | 10:15-12:00, 19:20-21:30]
   During pair work, 8 of 12 students verbally justified their reasoning 
   using mathematical vocabulary ("unit rate," "constant ratio"). Students 
   built on each other's ideas, particularly when analyzing the non-proportional 
   example at 19:20.

2. [A1 | 07:45, 11:20, 16:00, 23:45]
   Teacher used strategic questioning to probe student thinking four times, 
   with follow-ups like "Why does that matter?" and "How do you know?" These 
   checks revealed misconceptions about proportional vs. linear relationships.

3. [CEC3 | 03:30, 15:00]
   Visual supports (color-coded table headers, sentence stems) were visible 
   and referenced by 3 students during explanations, lowering language barriers.

WONDERINGS (Coaching Questions)

1. [P2] Success criteria were posted but not co-constructed or revisited 
   mid-lesson. What might happen if students helped generate or self-assess 
   against the criteria at the 15-minute mark?

2. [A2] Several students received verbal affirmation ("good") but limited 
   specific feedback on their reasoning. How might you make feedback more 
   actionable, perhaps naming the specific move ("You used the unit rate...").

3. [SE2] What routine could help students track their own progress toward 
   the learning target during the lesson?

## Glows & Grows
```
GLOWS (Strengths Aligned to 5D+)

✓ SE1, SE3 [10:15-12:00, 19:20-21:30]
  Structured talk routines (Think-Pair-Share, accountable talk stems) 
  created space for 8 unique student voices to explain mathematical reasoning. 
  This made student thinking visible and built collective understanding.
  WHY IT MATTERS: Students constructed meaning together rather than relying 
  solely on teacher explanation.

✓ CP3 [05:15-06:45]
  Teacher modeled a complete worked example ("I do") with think-aloud before 
  releasing students to try. The model explicitly connected unit rate to 
  proportionality.
  WHY IT MATTERS: Clear modeling reduced cognitive load and gave students 
  a mental schema to apply.

✓ A1 [throughout]
  CFU checks every 6-8 minutes prevented students from practicing errors 
  and allowed real-time instructional pivots.

GROWS (Growth Areas with Actionable Nudges)

↑ P2 [03:12, not revisited]
  Success criteria were teacher-created and not referenced after posting. 
  NUDGE: Co-construct criteria with students OR pause at 15 minutes to have 
  students self-assess against them using color cards (red/yellow/green).

↑ A2 [multiple moments]
  Feedback was encouraging but often general ("Good job," "Nice"). 
  NUDGE: Name the specific move ("You used the unit rate to compare—that's 
  exactly what mathematicians do") or pose a pressing question to extend thinking.

↑ SE2 [limited evidence]
  Few opportunities for students to self-assess or set personal goals.
  NUDGE: Add a 2-minute reflection prompt tied to the success criteria 
  (e.g., "Which part of today's SC do you feel strongest about? Where do you 
  need more practice?").

## SMART Goal Template
```
SMART GOAL

GOAL STATEMENT:
By [Date, 2-4 weeks out], during [lesson type/content], [specific measurable 
outcome] will increase from [baseline] to [target] as measured by [evidence type].

EXAMPLE:
By December 15, 2025, during problem-solving lessons, student-to-student 
discourse will increase from ~30% to ≥50% of class time as measured by two 
10-minute talk tallies per week in at least 3 lessons.

MEASUREMENT:
- Teacher will tally teacher vs. student talk during 2 ten-minute segments 
  per week
- Collect 2 student artifacts (written explanations or recordings) showing 
  peer-to-peer interaction
- Student survey: "How often do you explain your thinking to classmates?"

EVIDENCE COLLECTION SCHEDULE:
- Week 1: Baseline tally + introduce talk moves
- Week 2: Mid-point tally + student artifact #1
- Week 3: Tally + student artifact #2
- Week 4: Final tally + student survey

SUPPORTS NEEDED:
- Talk moves reference card (observer will provide)
- Peer observation of colleague using accountable talk structures
- 10-minute check-in on [Date] to troubleshoot

### Processing Tips
- **Timestamp precision:** Use MM:SS format consistently
- **Actor codes:** T=Teacher, S=Student (generic), S-A/S-B/S-C (specific anonymized), S-Group
- **Confidence scoring:** 1.0 = certain, 0.7-0.9 = likely, <0.7 = ambiguous (flag for review)
- **Evidence linking:** Always provide timestamp range for multi-moment patterns
- **PII replacement:** Use find/replace to catch all instances of student names
