# Privacy, Compliance & Quality Assurance

## Privacy & Compliance Requirements

### Student PII Redaction
**ALWAYS redact:**
- Full student names → Use role codes (S-A, S-B, S-Group)
- Student IDs, addresses, phone numbers
- Sensitive health information
- Behavioral incident details that could identify individuals

**Example:**
- Original: "Maria raised her hand and explained..."
- Redacted: "S-A raised her hand and explained..."

### Legal Compliance
- **FERPA:** Protect all student education records
- **IDEA:** Reference accommodations generically ("student with IEP received visual support") without diagnosis
- **Section 504:** Note access strategies without revealing disability
- **Michigan Teacher Evaluation Law:** Ensure evaluations are evidence-based, tied to student growth, and follow district timelines

### Data Security
- Store all files in secure district-approved locations
- Use encrypted email for transmission
- Include only aggregate data (no individual student scores) in written artifacts
- Mark evaluation documents as "Confidential Personnel Record"

## Edge Cases & Special Situations

### Virtual/Hybrid Observations
- **Tag virtual interactions:** `[Virtual]` for chat, polls, breakout rooms
- **Count chat as discourse:** SE1 evidence includes typed responses
- **Note accessibility:** Are closed captions, screen reader compatibility, and visual supports enabled?
- **Two-way interaction requirement:** Michigan virtual law requires documented student-teacher interaction

### Short/Partial Observations (<15 minutes)
- Produce **mini-packet**: Scripted notes, 1 glow, 1 grow, 1 wondering
- Label scope clearly: "15-minute segment focused on [activity]"
- Note what was NOT observed
- Avoid broad claims; focus on what was visible

### Missing Data
- **No explicit LT/SC:** Infer cautiously, mark `(inferred from lesson content)`, add to clarifying questions
- **Audio gaps:** Mark span `[Audio gap 12:30-14:15]` and continue
- **Unclear dimension:** Code with lower confidence score, add note

### Equity Concerns
- **Identify pattern neutrally:** "3 of 5 higher-order questions directed to students in front rows"
- **Suggest mitigation:** "Consider randomizer or popsicle sticks for equitable distribution"
- **Never attribute intent:** Focus on observable impact, not assumed motivation
- **Connect to CEC dimension:** Frame as growth opportunity in CEC1 or CEC3

### Emergency/Crisis Observations
- If observation reveals **immediate safety concern** (abuse, threat, severe distress), PAUSE coding
- Notify administrator immediately per district protocol
- Do NOT include concerning details in written observation notes
- Complete incident report through proper channels separately

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing any evaluation artifact, verify:

**Evidence Quality**
- [ ] Every claim is tied to specific timestamp or artifact
- [ ] Student names are redacted (S-A, S-B format)
- [ ] Quotes are verbatim or marked as paraphrased
- [ ] No value-laden adjectives ("great," "poor," "lazy")
- [ ] Impact on student learning is explicit

**5D+ Coding Accuracy**
- [ ] Every significant moment has dimension + subdimension
- [ ] Tags (LT, FA, EQUITY, Virtual) are used appropriately
- [ ] Confidence scores reflect certainty (use <0.7 when ambiguous)
- [ ] Matrix organizes evidence logically by dimension

**Analysis Depth**
- [ ] Noticings are factual, not interpretive
- [ ] Wonderings are open-ended, coaching-oriented
- [ ] Glows explain WHY the move mattered for students
- [ ] Grows include specific, actionable nudges
- [ ] All linked to evidence timestamps

**SMART Goal Criteria**
- [ ] Specific to one dimension/subdimension
- [ ] Measurable with concrete metrics
- [ ] Achievable in 2-4 week timeframe
- [ ] Relevant to student learning (not just teacher behavior)
- [ ] Time-bound with check-in date
- [ ] Includes evidence collection plan
- [ ] Lists supports and resources

**Document Completeness**
- [ ] Header metadata complete (teacher, date, course, observer)
- [ ] File names follow convention
- [ ] All cross-references are accurate
- [ ] Email summary is concise (fits in one screen)
- [ ] JSON export validates against schema
