    "post_content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m looking for genuine, honest advice because I don\u2019t really have anyone guiding me through this and I\u2019m starting to second-guess myself. I\u2019m 18 and recently attended American Military University (AMU). I struggled badly with burnout, anxiety, and stress, which seriously affected my academics. I lost financial aid there due to SAP issues and was dropped from courses when I couldn\u2019t pay out of pocket. I completed about 9 credits total. I\u2019ve learned a lot from that experience and I\u2019m trying to reset slowly and responsibly, not rush into another bad situation. Right now, I\u2019m deciding between Liberty University Online and SNHU (online). Here\u2019s my situation and plan: \u2022 I want to take only 2 classes at a time \u2022 I am not taking out student loans \u2022 I\u2019m prioritizing mental health and pacing myself \u2022 Liberty confirmed my SAP does NOT follow me, so I\u2019d have a clean slate there \u2022 I understand all transcripts still matter long-term \u2022 I\u2019m okay transferring again later if needed once I\u2019m academically stable  My concerns: \u2022 Liberty\u2019s reputation (I\u2019ve seen very mixed opinions, some extremely negative) \u2022 SNHU seems to have a better general reputation, but I don\u2019t know how strict they are with prior SAP issues \u2022 I don\u2019t want to go into debt or end up with credits that don\u2019t transfer \u2022 I want a school that\u2019s flexible, asynchronous, and realistic for someone rebuilding academically  My goals: \u2022 Finish a bachelor\u2019s degree (health-related field) \u2022 Possibly attend grad school later if I\u2019m able (I want to go to PA school once I graduate) \u2022 Avoid unnecessary debt \u2022 Prove to myself I can succeed academically when paced correctly  I\u2019m not here to argue or defend any school \u2014 I genuinely want to make the smartest, safest decision given my history. If you were in my position: \u2022 Would you choose Liberty Online or SNHU? \u2022 Is starting at Liberty to rebuild GPA and then transferring a bad idea? Cause that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of doing right now \u2022 Are the reputation concerns something that actually matters in real life, or more online discourse?  I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to respond thoughtfully. I\u2019m trying to do better and not repeat past mistakes.    submitted by    /u/sillycars_27   [link]   [comments]",

Maybe 3 students in my class repeatedly cry, throw chairs, pick up tables, scream, kick and hit things in the room. I feel so so so bad calling admin in so much but I had tried everything, and their behavior doesn\u2019t let the rest of the class learn and is unsafe! I\u2019ve tried parents, positive reinforcement, rewards. Nothing is working. Is it the area? Is it the grade? Is it the school? Is it the county? Please please I\u2019m in so much need for advice. I ask the students what their parents say and they usually say they said nothing. Maybe it\u2019s the grade level? I can\u2019t even teach. Like, it\u2019s bizarre. I feel like I should be a paid counselor for these students on top of my teacher salary because I work so much before, during, and afterschool. Then I have to constantly deal with behaviors. It honestly feels impossible and I don\u2019t like who I am at the end of everyday because the students who are always listening and behaving cat even get my attention due to the bad behavior ones. Do I ignore the behaviors???? Do I dismiss??? Or is this expected and normal in kindergarten to do this all day. There\u2019s also no plan for the behaviors, they come in the next hour or so from the office with a \u201csorry\u201d piece of paper then repeat the behavior 2 minutes later. I\u2019m drowning and don\u2019t know if this stress is worth the pay. Documentation, lesson planning in my free time (nonexistent during contract hours) meetings, data expectations, observations, parents, im drowning. I go home and do more work I couldn\u2019t get done during the day and feel like I yelled at kids all day and hate myself\u2026 and slowly this job    submitted by    /u/RadiantPixieDust   [link]   [comments]",

    "post_content": "I\u2019m a preschool teacher and have this sweet little 4 year old in my class. For the last year she has primarily been dropped off and picked up by dad. Recently their custody agreement changed and mom has been picking up a couple times a week. For the last few weeks she has been going to our director and accusing my coteacher and I of not changing her child\u2019s pull up as she\u2019s been wet every time she\u2019s picked her up. We were perplexed as we know we do change her regularly. However, yesterday\u2026we\u2019re all at the bathroom and I changed, we\u2019re gonna call her Sally, and not even a minute later her mom shows up to get her. Sally looks a bit sad and mom checks her pull up and sure enough\u2026it\u2019s wet. That\u2019s when we put together exactly what was going on. We told our director who believes us but doesn\u2019t want to offend the mom. What do we do now??? We don\u2019t want to keep being harassed about something that\u2019s not actually happening but also won\u2019t go over our bosses head.. ETA: I\u2019m so sorry for everyone who was concerned we weren\u2019t reporting this! I see now how that read and want to clarify our director has reported this to CPS! I\u2019m so sorry I figured everyone would know we did that as we are all mandatory reporters. I have been in this field for years, just because I do not personally believe there\u2019s physical abuse at home, does not mean we wouldn\u2019t report what is an obvious sign of distress. I\u2019m sorry to anyone who was concerned about that! My post was more about seeking advice on how to handle mom going forward as we can\u2019t just tell her we called CPS. I just don\u2019t want to be berated anymore for something that\u2019s not happening. Also, we do have an app where all her bathroom breaks are documented, mom just doesn\u2019t believe they\u2019re actually happening.    submitted by    /u/Automatic_Rip7076   [link]   [comments]",

    "post_content": "I'm trying to understand if this is typical or just my school. I teach a middle school elective. We have an eight period day. The core teachers (math, ELA, social studies, and science) teach five periods, have a team period, prep and lunch. Elective teachers teach six (not five, edited) periods, have a prep and lunch. We are not compensated for the extra class, even though elementary and high school teachers are. We've brought it up with the union, but since it only affects a small percentage of the whole union, they don't seem to care. The core teachers get information during their team periods. Administration will come in and discuss issues. Guidance will touch base during team periods. Elective teachers are out of the loop. We don't find out about assemblies until a day before, if that. It makes planning hard. The core teachers use their team meeting for grading and planning on most days. When they do discuss students, they don't communicate with the elective teachers. Recently they had a meeting with a parent about their child failing. The Spanish teacher and music teacher didn't know about the meeting and weren't told about it until two weeks later. Are there any middle school teachers that have a middle school model that works?    submitted by    /u/Material-Rise9610   [link]   [comments]",

    "post_content": "After 22 years of teaching, I reached out to this community to ask for tips and advice on how to stay positive in the profession and, ultimately, how to reach retirement still enjoying the job. The grind had started to get to me, and I was looking for some perspective. The responses I received were genuinely amazing, thoughtful, and reassuring, so I wanted to share them here in the hope that they might help others too. I would also really love to hear your thoughts and experiences in the comments. .  Work in a school where you have friends This was mentioned repeatedly, and it makes absolute sense. If you are going to school every day, you are essentially going to spend your time with people, so make sure those people are ones you genuinely like. When your colleagues are your friends, work becomes somewhere you want to go. Investing emotional energy into building positive relationships with staff can completely change how each day feels. Never stop learning your subject Staying curious and continually developing your subject knowledge came up a lot. Taking courses, reading, or exploring new ideas within your subject does not just make you better at your job, it re-energises you. That new knowledge feeds into conversations with colleagues and, more importantly, into your teaching. When you are excited about what you teach, pupils feel it. It keeps lessons fresh and reminds you why you loved your subject in the first place. Stay away from the bitching This one was huge. So many staffrooms, and sometimes SLTs, can become incredibly toxic. The advice was to have a zero tolerance for bitching, moaning, and constant negativity. That kind of environment just eats away at your energy day after day. Surround yourself with positive, solution-focused people and quietly step away from conversations that drag you down. Protecting your energy is essential for longevity. Remember you are dealing with kids This felt like the most important reminder of all. Even the best kids get it wrong. Poor behaviour is not a personal attack, and taking it as one will exhaust you. Pupils come from hugely varied backgrounds and bring all of that into school with them. The advice was to stay emotionally detached from poor behaviour, respond professionally, but do not internalise it. Behaviour will always be challenging, even in the best schools, and that is just part of working with children.  There were also a few smaller nuggets that made me smile, like \u201cbe good enough that they leave you alone\u201d, but overall, these four stood out.    submitted by    /u/P45teachingpodcast   [link]   [comments]",

    "post_content": "Most of my classes are great, but I have like 1 or 2 classes where the same 5-6 kids are asking to go to the bathroom, and it literally is chipping away at my willpower.  I used to be very easy going on the bathroom till admin dinged me on an observation for letting kids go to the bathroom too easily. Now I try to really only let one or two go at a time.  But every day it's the same kids, and I know most of them just want to walk around for a bit. Which I'm cool with most of the time, but when you're shouting out \"Can I go to the bathroom now?\" or \"Am I next?\" when someone goes back, even as I'm trying to explain something, it makes me wanna just tell everyone no.  I have empathy for kids who just need a moment to walk around. I have empathy for the kids who need a break because they struggle with reading and writing, and want a moment to breathe. But when kid after kid after kid after kid is asking and I can't even hear myself think. And it's in my classes where most of them could realistically go before class because they have a 15-minute and 30-minute break before hand.  Like today, as I was talking to the whole class, a kid just shouted out, \"Can I go refill my water bottle?\"  I feel like with bathroom policies, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. Like, if you let kids out constantly and they cause trouble, the admin will come at you. If you don't let kids out, kids complain, and the admin comes to you.  Or you let one kid out, he takes close to an hour because he just wanted to walk around and doesn't care about the other kids, and suddenly they're complaining because he's taking too long.     submitted by    /u/Consistent-Row-9551   [link]   [comments]",

He's a brilliant kid, but he has a major problem with touching himself in class, trying to reach up my skirt, and reaching for my chest area.  I have reported this multiple times to my manager. And I immediately remove myself when he reaches for me inappropriately. All my manager does is call him into the office to calmly talk to him. (This is a gentle parenting/parent ass kisser school).  This week I caught him m******ing to completion in my class. I was absolutely horrified. Never in my 10 years of teaching have seen this from a 6 year old.  I immediately went to my manager and said we NEED to take action. I met with his mother once, who casually brushed his self-touching off as normal. (Okay, yes it's normal as a self soothing mechanism with some children who have special needs - but NOT to this degree!!!)  My concern is abuse, exposer to something, or other harm.  After doing everything from redirection, applying all I've learned from experience and training, and constant reporting, I got blamed for this: My manager called me in to say that my dresses are too short (4 fingers above the knee). And that this could be one of the causes.  I was stunned and couldn't find words. How am I even in this position? Am I at fault?

I was homeschooled my entire life until high school, mostly by my father. Looking back, I believe he seriously damaged my self-esteem and nervous system. Even now, stress causes intense physical reactions flushing, sweating, my mind going blank, and breaking down crying. As a child, I lived in constant fear of making mistakes. He would raise his voice, bulge his eyes, throw things, and violently break objects if I got something wrong. Asking for help never felt safe, even though I was told to \u201cask questions.\u201d He said many cruel things. Even harmless things I enjoyed, like watching princess movies, were mocked. He told me things like, \u201cThis BS makes you an idiot.\u201d Sometimes my mom would get angry at him and he\u2019d apologize later, promising it wouldn\u2019t happen again but it always did. When she wasn\u2019t around, he told me not to tell her. I became so afraid of mistakes that I started cheating just to avoid his anger. When he found out, he said I had made him a liar for telling people I was smart. I felt completely alone. I believe this led to depression. I wanted someone to help me out of that life SO bad.

    "post_content": "I know this has been talked about in this sub but this week I experienced two situations of colleagues remarking on the minimum failing score 50's thing our school implemented this year, by that I mean the principal. If one enters a 0 in the grade book (we use Jupiter), their grade defaults to a 50. In fact, anything under a 50 is a 50, whether it is a blank paper or whether the student tried but did not succeed. Monday we had small group meetings and this dominated the conversation for the first 30 minutes. One teacher remarked \"this is just grade inflation. It is unethical.\" She showed the grades of a student who got a 74 in marking period one and then just did not show up for the 2nd and 3rd marking periods, and whom would get a 67 overall grade. \"I just can not in good conscience give this student a passing grade, I won't do it\" was her followup remark. Just today, this was also the discussion in our grade team meetings. One colleague who has been teaching for nearly 50 years stated he was more concerned about the high flyers, the ones who come in, want to be challenged and get high grades, considering that they may not be as willing to do the work. Some students have already figured the system out and are exploiting it so to speak. I don't know if this will lead to real change. Our principal is generally supportive, but on this one issue, which I told her last year was a really bad idea for obvious reasons, distinctly started the year with \"We'll have conversations about this.\" There were no conversations, a decision was made and that was it. However, given the groundswell of opposition, being that no teacher in our school supports this, perhaps conversations will be had, especially as we round out the Fall semester.    submitted by    /u/bkrugby78   [link]   [comments]",

She was back on her bs this week attacking me, putting me down, not agreeing with our curriculum and how it\u2019s taught.  Had an emotional support student have outbursts every single day, causing disruption to my lessons.  Was told a parent called the principal and shared that their student was shoved by said student above and upset that I didn\u2019t let them know\u2026 I had no idea this happened. Wasn\u2019t under my watch.  Had 2 students make racist comments about others. Called home. One laughed and told me their child said nothing wrong.  Veteran teachers\u2026 how do you deal with this ongoing BS? I want to teach. I\u2019m so sick of crappy parents and insane behaviors.     submitted by    /u/summalovinnn   [link]   [comments]",

    "post_content": "Okay buckle up cause this is a lot. Since the start of the school year, my whole class has been targeting and bullying this one child. I\u2019m talking more than just name calling. Now some background on this child. He was fully diagnosed with autism when he was younger, then one day parents said he no longer has autism and fully declines any and all services\u2026take that as you will. Naturally, this child severely lacks any kind of social awareness. Anyway, my class has constantly targeted him and will do anything to get him in trouble and make themselves look like the victim. They\u2019ve constantly push him around, purposely try to trip him, chase him at recess, lie to adults about his behaviors, and start full on fights with him. There\u2019s been so many instances where admin has come up to my room to have whole class discussions on their behaviors. Well today they took it even further. Long story short, kids violently attacked him while the others circled around and cheered. I now have multiple kids that are suspended and this child is moving to a new class.  Here\u2019s where I need help\u2026I\u2019m worried my class will see this as a win and a reward because they are getting what they want. Him moved to a different class. I need them to know how extremely serious this is. I\u2019m sure admin will come in and talk but that\u2019s clearly meant nothing to them every other time. My class has already been on \u201cprobation\u201d because of other behavior issues they\u2019ve had this year. So they\u2019ve lost all tech use, fun games, and the ability to talk while they work (I wish I was exaggerating when I say they literally cannot say anything nice when they speak). What is something I can do as a whole class punishment that would MAYBE help them realize how serious this is? Like I\u2019m honestly thinking of asking admin to invite all their parents to come to my room and have a full on discussion about what\u2019s been going on, but I don\u2019t know how well that would go. I\u2019m open to anything!!! P.S. the 4 kids who are never involved wouldn\u2019t be a part of this punishment, though they will be there for my talk about speaking up for others.

    "post_content": "Cw: Mentions of child abuse and educational neglect.  So, I've been getting recommended videos about public school crisis and why teachers are flat out giving up and quitting in the middle of the year (many didn't come back from winter break I guess?). I have spent pretty much my entire adult life condemning homeschooling as an unregulated void that hides abused children, and I still feel that way. But listening to these videos is genuinely heartbreaking. I don't have any kids, my dysfunctional family is a big reason why, but I had a thought during one of these videos that I'd rather homeschool my hypothetical kids than have them rot like this, but the thought made me feel lowkey disgusted and ashamed of myself because I'd rather homeschooling be illegal than have even one child grow up and have to overcome the level of educational neglect that I did. But the experience that some of these kids are having sounds almost worse in some ways than the educational neglect I had and I just can't even understand how that's possible. I had some formal education before I was homeschooled, and I still remember being challenged and what real school was like. I can't even imagine how severe the consequence would have been if my parents were told I was doing that bad. Now, I can't even blame some parents for looking at this situation and not wanting their kids to be apart of it. The whole thought spiral just made me feel like a massive hypocrite and I don't even know what to think about any of it now. I just feel an overwhelming sadness for the upcoming generation of kids. One of the videos I watched had a horrible but likely true comment, that the next class divide is going to be who can read and think critically, and who can't. And that's just heartbreaking. I feel like no matter what, there's a whole generation of kids who are going to have to go through everything I went through as I struggled to find autonomy in adulthood when they shouldn't have to, and the salvation is, what? Private school or the unregulated hell scape that is homeschooling? What a depressing thought.    submitted by    /u/LinverseUniverse   [link]   [comments]",

    "post_content": "I want to hear thoughts and opinions from all the math educators out there about an issue that my and my colleagues have had for a while. The issue is that most of what we teach for our freshman Algebra is just 8th grade skills according to our state standards yet none of our freshman in Algebra 1 have any of these skills or have even remotely retained them from 8th grade. For reference: I teach in WA state and I noticed that a skill for solving systems of equations is an 8th grade skill. I always thought it was a 9th grade skill, and I remembering doing it when I took Algebra 1 as an 8th grader but that was because I was on an accelerated track. As a teacher for the past 5 years I have always taught it as a 9th grade skill, but this has been from the ground up, no review or previous knowledge by any students. In fact, I have to teach solving one-step equations from the ground up and still at least 1/5 of my students at this point through the year fail to solve at least a couple variants of one-step equations. (Most are pretty good but it has taken many weeks to get there.) It is just wild to me to have slowly learned over time that most of the content I am teaching for 9th graders should have been taught to them in 8th grade. There are some pieces here or there that my 9th graders do recall from 8th grade but their ability to retain it is crap, even for my accelerated 9th graders that passed Algebra 1 in 8th grade and are in Geometry in 9th grade, their Algebra 1 skills are sometimes as just as bad as the non-accelerated learners. So my question to all of you is have you experienced the same thing? What have you done about it? Is this the fault of elementary and middle schools teachers not preparing students enough for high school? Is it a lack of skills by the students themselves?    submitted by    /u/Ichthyslovesyou   [link]   [comments]",

The lady from the office says \"she will be shadowing you for a few days and then she will be teaching.\" \"Oh, which class \" say \"this one the lady says\" and walks off, doesn't tell me anything else. They gave me no prior notice, so I was shocked at this. Technically I was contracted to the school through an agency so I called my agency and they said they had only just heard about it. But for days couldn't get any details or what procedures I was supposed to do to turn in the property I had of the school (laptop, keys, etc.). Even the principal of the school didn't know because she sent me an email the next day where she talked as if I was going to be there, so it had come form the higher ups in the district. Has anyone experienced anything like this? I live in an at will employment state, so technically I can be fired for just about anything but my agency contract says they would have to receive prior notice.     submitted by    /u/Teacherman13   [link]   [comments]",

He stopped talking about all the \"daddies\" picking up and dropping off students. However, in Art class he started sketching the boy who punched him's dad's truck. He even drew the license plate. (This student got away with it because he scored the highest on state tests.) * A female students calling the middle aged PE teacher \"daddy.\" She's saying it just loud enough for the teacher to not hear. * A bully of a student was using racial slurs only when the only Black student seemingly moved away. The student came back, heard about the slurs, and pounced on him. * A student calling himself \"the head doctor.\" * I took FMLA off because I didn't want to get COVID. First day out, the \"movie actor good looking\" student told my teacher replacement that her \"breath smells like her unwashed p----y,\" just because she dared to correct his behavior. * I had a non-verbal student with Autism. He wore onesies and overalls. Mom was petite so she and I would put the garments on her nearly 6-foot son. When I brought up needing another paraprofessional, because this student also head-butted female paraprofessionals and frequently masturbated, the SPED director told me to let him masturbate each morning \"to get it out his system\" because \"it's a biological need.\" * The student who lost both parents within one calendar year happened to be one of the most well-adjusted students I ever had.

Nearly every meeting I've been to about it, most teachers are fully behind it...I was too until I started seeing some schools plans.  Overwhelmingly, the method used around here is that each room has a calculator storage thing hanging somewhere in the room. Slots are numbered and each kid is assigned a spot to put their phone.  We'd hear from students that liked not having the phones (after a period of separation anxiety of course)... we'd hear from teachers that loved the attention their lesson got instead of a phone. We'd hear from admin that talked about the decrease in write ups... But one question I had always gets swept under the rug...What happens when a kid loses a phone, or gets it stolen from the hanging storage thing? The first answer everyone gives is the reason things like the storage case is a bad idea. \"Where was the teacher, why aren't they I'm control of their room so this does not happen\".  I'm a math teacher, have a math degree and a master's in education. I am not a cellphone police officer. In addition to being responsible for the myriad of things we do...now I have to be liable for over $10000 of electronics every period?

    "post_content": "I think under the right circumstances, homeschooling can help a kids thrive. Enough socialization is key. Unfortunately I didn't have that. I have been dying to share my story with anyone who will listen and tell me I'm not crazy for feeling the way I feel. I was in regular school until I was 7. My mom had me start school a year late because she didn't think I was ready. That caused a lot of problems for me. I was constantly bullied, and the teachers barely batted an eyelash, since \"I was older and I could deal with it\". I know what the kids and teachers did was wrong, but I still hold this against my mom for not giving me a fair chance. I was in regular school from age 4-7 (Jewish schools have three grades before 1st grade: nursery where kids are 3 turning 4, kindergarten, where kids are 4 turning 5, and pre1A, which is basically pre first grade, where kids are 5 turning 6. My birthday is in February, so I was a full year and more older than my peers. I was also very emotional and cried a lot which definitely didn't help my case (was diagnosed with very high functioning ADHD last year so might have had something to do with this). I really could have benefited from therapy then, but didn't start until I was 16. My mom started homeschooling me when I was in first grade. She said we were just going to try it out for a few weeks. A few weeks turned into years and years. I didn't mind so much. I was able to sleep in, and I was able to take a little more time with my schoolwork if needed. And if I finished early enough, I got to watch TV for the rest of the day. My mom said I was a happy kid. But there were so many signs that I was crying for help that she missed. First of all, socialization was a joke. The only time we left the house during the week was to go grocery shopping, but if my mom didn't need to run any errands, I would easily go two-three days without leaving the house. I was extremely lucky to have friends. I had a group of girls on my block that I was very friendly with, but didn't start hanging out with regularly until I was ten, so from age 7-10 the only kid I would play with regularly was my sister who I fought with all the time. My friends were not homeschooled so the only time I would see them was on Saturdays (the Sabbath, which is the Jewish day of rest). I remember whenever I wasn't able to see them, I would cry and cry. I did not make any new friends until adulthood. I wasn't in summer camp. I wasn't in any extra curricular activities. I didn't realize how much this messed me up until adulthood. As for academics, I didn't really have to work so hard, so I didn't. I did the work but that's it. Didn't retain much info and had a hard time focusing. My ADHD diagnosis back in June made everything click into place.  Now as an adult, I feel that I am doing okay. Not great, but okay. I have made many more friends and I am working part time. I am hopefully getting my ged in May so please pray for me y'all. If you guys are wondering about my feelings towards my mom, I think it was very brave of her to take on a role as a single stay at home mom. I think she truly tried her best but at the end of the day, the results matter more than the intentions. Do I forgive her? For the most part, yes. Do I still get very upset when I think about my childhood? Yes. I have talked to my mom multiple times about what I went through and she is adamant that I was a happy kid and thrived. She refuses to acknowledge that it was anything but a positive experience. I have given up on trying to change her mind. Here's the thing: I am not against homeschooling at all. I think under the right circumstances, it can be very beneficial for a child, given that they have the academic and social tools needed. I don't plan on homeschooling my future kids, but if I end up doing it, things are sure going to be a lot different than how I experienced it.

    "post_content": "So this could be a long post but I will try and keep it short so that you actually want to read it. Basically I teach in a PreK-8 school in Canada, it\u2019s my first year here. We\u2019re at 1280ish students. I teach grade 4/5.  Since before the break there has been this class, 5/6, ran by \u201cMs. Smith\u201d, that has gotten out of control. Like to the point if you\u2019re near her classroom you can hear her yelling at them or the kids causing problems inside or in the hallway. The kids themselves are good kids but I personally think it\u2019s just a bad mix of big personalities. The teacher herself I actually went to university with and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a bad teacher, I just think it\u2019s a bad fit. Before the break there were whispers that the school was quietly trying to push her to take a stress leave. She had a sub the entire last week before the break. During that time her class was even more awful.  Twice during that week admin asked me to help out during my preps and in return let me skip all my lunch supervision son a nice cold week and still keep my pay. Frankly this is a great trade off when you\u2019re a wimp like me (who never accomplished anything during preps anyways). Her class was fine for me. Not amazing, but no different than my own class. Both times admin would check in and nothing would be wrong. I never saw them ask any other teachers to help out besides me\u2026 After the break she returned. But it seems things haven\u2019t gotten any better I guess. Multiple times her students have been lurking around my room or following me at recess to talk to me. It seems they prefer me. That\u2019s nice and all but I have a class already\u2026 Today I was asked if during my prep again if I would cover her class and instead I would get a second prep today because there\u2019s extra subs in the building. I said sure again without thinking much about it. Then when I got there admin says that he and their teacher will stay so that he can make her observe how I handle the class and deal with behaviours. It was so awkward. But again no issues. After school today I didn\u2019t stay long because literally everyone else was leaving so I though okay screw this I\u2019ll mark it at home and started leaving too.

    "post_content": "for reference i'm in my early 20s and because of the isolation from being homeschooled by my mother i've never consensually engaged in intimate acts or kissed anyone and have never dated. for the years i've been legally an adult i've been unable to find work because of my ged and thus have not been able to move out of my parents' house or socialize while living here. because of this life i see no point in dating or companionship and feel no desire for either unless inebriated or extremely distraught. most of my interaction with people outside of my family is through the internet who i'm aware also probably have a warped view but they revere love more than anything and most of what they talk about relates to it. this has gone on so long ive begun to question whether \"love\" as depicted in western art is something that even exists. ive had multiple therapists and tried to bring up my inability to feel or understand love but they all were vetted by my parents and put me down or quickly changed the subject when i brought it up. i assume this isn't a unique experience and someone with experience being homeschooled or raised in isolation/a cult has written about dealing with it, either by somehow beginning to feel love or accepting the inability to feel it.    submitted by    /u/onlylovedatnight   [link]   [comments]",

    "post_content": "Friday will be my last day as an 8th grade inclusion teacher. Before that, I taught 7th grade ELA for three years and inclusion for three years. Now that my brain has finally slowed down enough to look back, I find myself asking how I stayed in a job that often felt more harmful than healthy for so long. If it wasn\u2019t coming from students\u2014who were often sent right back after serious behaviors, somehow making teachers feel at fault for documenting them\u2014it seemed to come from elsewhere. From a lack of support. From poor communication. From little encouragement or positive feedback. From feeling unheard by leadership and sometimes even colleagues. With low pay and limited resources, this job is incredibly hard. Hard in ways that aren\u2019t always visible to people outside the classroom. And at some point, I realized I no longer had what I needed to truly support my students the way they deserve. What I do know is this: my students were loved. Deeply. Every single day. And that part was real and never wasted. I\u2019m not alone in feeling this way\u2014many teachers I\u2019ve spoken to feel the same exhaustion and confusion. I\u2019m choosing to step away to take care of myself and to find a healthier path forward. To teachers still in it: I see you. This work is heavy, and you are not weak for feeling that     submitted by    /u/kraftkristi   [link]   [comments]",

I can\u2019t even read a single page of a book and I can\u2019t comprehend it. I\u2019ve begun to read the Hunchback of Notre-Dame by Victor Hugo for an online literature class I\u2019m in, but whenever I try to read the assigned pages, my mind just drifts elsewhere, I grab my phone or start fidgeting with my fingers or anything around me and I just can\u2019t comprehend it. I can\u2019t. Like it feels impossible to try and read it and for the words to click or go through my head and get processed especially because it\u2019s very wordy and confusing. I used it be so smart and ambitious but now I\u2019m literally stupid atp. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t done math in months and I feel like my life is over and i\u201dm doomed. I just can\u2019t anymore. I plan to cut back on my social media usage and doomscrolling(I have a phone addiction) and I\u2019ve been going out to take walks in my backyard + take more online classes to stay away from my parents and slowly try to recover from this funk, but now I\u2019m going to do a math course with my mom teaching me. And I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll ever feel better and fix my chronic gut issues, I\u2018m so overwhelmed feeling like everything is over and my childhood is being robbed when I\u2019m only 14. Does anyone have tips to fix my attention span and try to understand the book I\u2019m reading and be disciplined and just read carefully, the words just aren\u2019t clicking in my head i feel beyond idiotic and my brain feels fried. I srsly can\u2019t anymore I feel constantly in flight or fight and stress and I can\u2019t focus on a thing (and my mom is anti therapy even tho my doctors continually recommend it, I think therapy would help with all my issues) I just feel hopeless right now.    submitted by    /u/Looveeat   [link]   [comments]",

And then we're not going to go into detail, but let's assume I use. Prompt similar to this. This was used for short code artifacts that I was synthetically generating with AI prompts would look something like this these will parse data and spit out structured json which will be use later to connect everything. #prompt: ``` Analyze a code artifact to extract advanced, domain-specific technical concepts (not basic programming). Scan imports, classes, and specialized functions to identify meaningful techniques, algorithms, libraries, and patterns. Organize these concepts hierarchically by domain, map them to where they appear in the code (functions and line numbers), and record their dependencies. Exclude basic constructs like loops and conditionals. Output the result as structured JSON representing a conceptual knowledge graph of the codebase. ``` Of Of course, this oversimplifies problem. Tracking the overall context of whole source code would be impossible. But I'm saying within the same realm, imagine we treat each file simply as. First we would have to find out where the core logic is, AT and what logic to avoid. 2nd we will just have to. Go in. Abstract away knowledge separated from the context. Just as a form of.

    "post_content": "I made this post for r/writing. But the post was pulled because it probably went into some topics that might be too serious/unrelated for a writing sub. So maybe it\u2019s be a better fit here idk I\u2019ve seen some of the previous threads about this topic before. But I feel like my situation is more specific, so I need more specific advice (and because I like to vent about stuff). For some context. I suffer from a pretty severe depression, alongside multiple mental illnesses that make focusing on anything feel almost impossible (ADHD, executive dysfunction, Malapadative daydreaming, etc). And on top of that\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m homeschooled. And if you know anything about that topic, you can probably understand why that\u2019s a problem for someone like me. I have no sense of routine, basically no oversight, and it\u2019s an environment that allows for procrastination spirals to go on for months. To be as blunt as possible. I\u2019ve essentially folded under the pressure of it all for a while now. I\u2019ve been fucking miserable, but at a certain point it felt like my situation was hopeless, and I decided to just give in to my worst impulses instead of focusing on trying to improve myself or my situation (I\u2019ve been procrastinating \u201cschool\u201c for three months at this point). But it\u2019s starting to set in for me that I have to do better, or else I have to legitimately consider the idea that I\u2019m going to end up dead by the time college comes around. I have a sense of urgency that only comes every so often, and I\u2019m desperate to actually put it to use. But there\u2019s something I need to overcome if I actually want to get out of my procrastination slump. And that is my pretty severe anxiety about writing, and more specifically how awful it all is. I feel like just from reading what I\u2019ve written so far can probably explain that better than I can. It\u2019s a fucking scatterbrained mess of topics that feel like they\u2019ve just been thrown out at once, with nothing actually being said beyond just listing issues I have. it\u2019s all just the weird ramblings of a mentally ill dude, and it\u2019s awful to read. And it\u2019s for that reason that I try and avoid writing unless I have to. It just makes me feel like complete shit, and serves as a reminder that I seemingly can\u2019t be talented at anything in life because of how my brain is wired. But ultimately, I have to push forward and get shit done, or else it\u2019s all but guaranteed I end up in that \u201cdead by college\u201c scenario I keep dreading. And the first step to solving that is getting over my writing anxiety. Ik it might be too big of an ask for y\u2019all (this is probably something that requires years of therapy/medication to truly overcome). But I don\u2019t have many options for support rn, so I\u2019m trying anything lol.    submitted by    /u/Evil_waffle3   [link]   [comments]",

    "post_content": "I went to a private Christian school in the 80's as Homeschooling was not as big as it is now. That school (Braircrest whom i now call Briarcult) often encouraged going to a christian college and then trying to get into public service/office, as a way to influence legislation locally and federally. I ended up going to a non religious college (secular) and i was a fish out of water. Science classes made little sense, history was whacked and english, at times, was like reading romance novels (books banned from Braircult).  I am curious how the Homeschool experience effected you if you went to a 'Secular' university.  I've been curious for decades on how Homeschoolers adapted to Science classes where evolution is nothing more than a shoulder shrug, because its not a disputed fact. How you felt in english classes reading 'forbidden' literature.  I am keenly aware that the Homeschool experience is also one of isolation. NO peer groups to joke around with, pass notes, play jokes. How did you handle and adapt to being on a large campus with a few thousand people or did you adapt? I know a couple of adult Homeschool folks socially. I will say as sweet as they are, they act like they are from a different planet. Social skills are odd and when you get into a real conversation, their worldview is often times shocking.  I have ZERO doubt that Ken Ham's Ark Experience stays afloat (pun intended) financially by the sea of Homeschoolers visiting that place.  If you were homeschooled but went to a non religious university, i would love to hear what it was like for you.    submitted by    /u/ghostofgroucho   [link]   [comments]",

    "post_content": "hello all, my three younger siblings (2 under 18) and i, 21F have been homeschooled our entire lives. most of my experience involved no consistent education, no social interactions, no friends, no exercise, no outside activities/sports, few doctor/dentist appointments, few family events, no village, no growth. for some background, when my dad was younger, he moved to a city a few hours away from his home. from what he\u2019s told me, he\u2019s never sounded like the antisocial type of person growing up. in fact he\u2019s done lots of traveling overseas, and has many funny stories from his child/young adulthood. he\u2019s always had a strong interest in computer science and engineering, which wasn\u2019t fully sparked until my mother pointed out his talent. my mother grew up in a well socialized environment with loving and involved parents. they were rougher around the edges due to the time period, but never cruel or abusive, i don\u2019t think. my dad\u2019s mom was wonderful to him, his father was.. unfriendly. i\u2019m not sure what my granddad\u2019s issue was, as i never actually met him, but he was a curmudgeon, a crank, if you will. after my parents fell in love is when my mom moved in. because we weren\u2019t in an area with great public schooling, they decided before having me that they\u2019d homeschool. they ordered the school materials, we were enrolled, but didn\u2019t do much of anything. most days just involved playing loudly with my siblings, talking, and watching tv. typing this out is hard. i wanna say i think we were happy, but i still get that overwhelming feeling of agonizing boredom and.. grey longing when i try recollecting my childhood. i don\u2019t truly know what most days were like. i don\u2019t remember much of anything before 2015. there\u2019s very large gaps in memory from before then, i guess because every day was the same. i\u2019m recently diagnosed ADHD, so multiply that boredom by 1000, and imagine it in the form of a pathogen, consuming that little girl\u2019s core. the only drug was daydreaming. i remember the music, nothing else. road trips and family visits still kinda stick out to me, but the memory of coming back home to a seemingly grey house in a quiet, grey suburban neighborhood in the grey part of town tends to overcloud it. we are very comfortable financially, so we were given many toys (and games/tech eventually.) dinner nights and movie visits are fuzzy, everything is fuzzy. i know we did some things outside of the house, but it never involved human connection.. no relationship building with outside kids. just.. shopping. or going out to eat. i was an angry kid in my adolescence, often taking my frustrations out on my loud, whiny, and aggressive younger brother who i now believe is on the spectrum. how would i know that..? maybe he\u2019s just weird because of our upbringing. maybe all of my siblings are just weird because of this lifestyle. no pets. too much work, and my dad didn\u2019t want us to experience grief at a young age, while my mom found most animals gross. a big reason for sheltering us was that they wanted to protect us from harm. my dad pulls up the statistics for SA against women when i question their reasoning. he doesn\u2019t regret protecting us from that. another concern was teen pregnancy. he\u2019s happy he got me through my teenage years with no children. my self image, sexuality, and views on sex and relationships are now damaged. my mom had a couple petty experiences in school that led her to sheltering us from bullying. apparently she\u2019s also seen things (?) in her previous line of work that validated her beliefs. we are not religious. my parents have their own faiths, but neither wanted to force them onto us, so we know nothing. we aren\u2019t mormons.  \u201cyou guys aren\u2019t missing out on anything. kids can\u2019t drive or walk around like in cartoons.\u201d this is what i received when the depression fully hit. and i think i believed them! \"i couldn\u2019t do nothing when i was your age either, trust me.\u201d i don\u2019t think i have the energy to finish this, so i\u2019ll wrap it up for now. one year ago now is when i started treatment for my crippling ADHD. i also made two very loyal friends. those friends and proper treatment made me realize how.. delusional my parents seem. they\u2019ll admit their mistakes, but don\u2019t really see anything wrong. i feel like my reality has been warped. they almost seem unreal now. they\u2019re usually never upset (unless i\u2019m upset,) they can\u2019t communicate on difficult topics, my mom misunderstands everything i ask her, my dad can\u2019t seem to stand negative emotions towards him, they\u2019re not interested in meeting people or doing anything really. they\u2019re like cartoon characters, or NPCs. no depth. the same stories every few weeks. same routine of watching tv and doing chores after work (from home) or outside chores/shopping. does this sound bizarre to you?

I was homeschooled my entire life and when it came time for me to go out on my own I could barely socialize, had zero idea what I was doing, was awkward around new people and struggled at my jobs. My parents praise it nonstop and tell us they did me and my siblings a favor by doing so, but in reality, they didn\u2019t. I struggled heavily in school understanding a lot of things and it didn\u2019t help when my mom would blow up on me and get extremely angry because I had a hard time understanding things. A lot of school time turned into screaming/yelling disasters and at some point it even turned physical when my mom would slap me for not understanding things. On top of that I even asked multiple times to go to public school so I could take some of the cool classes and advantage of some opportunities that would\u2019ve helped with my career, but all I was told was I would get \u201cinfluenced\u201d negatively, turn into a brat and be \u201cindoctrinated\u201d.

In schools I\u2019ve used structured literacy approaches aligned with Orton-Gillingham, but now that I\u2019m purchasing my own materials I\u2019m trying to be thoughtful about what\u2019s actually worth the investment. I\u2019d love to hear from tutors, interventionists, or parents about programs that are:  Effective for dyslexia and struggling readers Easy to use in 1:1 or small-group settings Flexible across grade levels Reasonably priced or good value for independent educators  I\u2019m especially interested in phonics, decoding, fluency, spelling, and reading comprehension resources that work well together. If you\u2019ve had success with specific programs, workbooks, or digital tools, I\u2019d really appreciate your input.

    "post_content": "I teach English as a second language at a high school. Yesterday, we had the word \"suspicious\" in our active vocabulary. The s-sh-s pattern is practically non-existent in their native language, and they couldn't pronounce it. I wasn't aware of their struggle until we started on the lexical activities. They were doing well and answering correctly until we got to 'suspicious.' They just said, \"word number five, miss.\" I said, \"which is?\" They just looked at each other and all at once burst into a chorus of \"shushpish.\" I laughed and repeated it. It took them a few tries of repeating after me to get it right, and every time they got it wrong, they just giggled. It made me so happy to see them laugh at their own mistakes and look so proud of themselves when they got it right. Those moments of levity and their impact on the students' self-esteem are not appreciated enough in my opinion.     submitted by    /u/alcorthebinarystar   [link]   [comments]",

I teach English as a Foreign Language to 14\u201316-year-old students. At the moment, our school only offers Diary of a Wimpy Kid and some very old short stories. My current class is roughly A2\u2013B1 level, and to be honest, many of my students are not very enthusiastic readers  I\u2019m looking for age-appropriate, engaging books that are linguistically accessible (A2/B1). A big plus would be a movie adaptation, as that really helps with motivation and comprehension Since we also have mixed-ability classes, I\u2019d also really appreciate recommendations for A1 or strong A2 level books.
